Project 4 Overview: 
	I first began this project by constructing a recursive call. After that
	I began coding using the knapsack algorithm as a reference. 
	
Bugs: 
	- the variable input, is added to the variable j as a whole and is not 
	broken up into individual indexes, causing a segmentation fault.
